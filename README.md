# Covid19_Data_Science_Practice
Covid-19 Data scrubbing, modeling, and plotting.
---

I used this data to learn more about data science.

The data is pulled directly from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data in each notebook.

State_County_Fips_Covid_NYTimes_Dataset.ipynb
 - Pulls in both state and state with county datasets and allows export to .csv

Ohio_Covid.ipynb
 - Pulls in datset, prepares dataset, uses a logistic regression model to predict a curve of infection.
 - *Now calculating updated infection rates daily*
  - Model built from various internet searches.

Montgomery_County_Covid.ipynb
 - Does the same as Ohio_Covid.ipynb but localized using fips data to Montgomery County Ohio

Hamilton_County_Covid_Cases.ipynb
 - Does the same as Ohio_Covid.ipynb but localized using fips data to Hamilton County Ohio


This was a fun learning project. I no longer work on this but I hope someone finds it interesting or useful.
